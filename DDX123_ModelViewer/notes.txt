- Loads the DamagedHelmet GLtf model and albedo texture.

TODO:
1. Clean up model / model load code, move to own file?
2. Add Model Matricies and other code to move models.
3. Add default scaling, controls, lighting

NOTES:

Alignment is important!! Texture wasn't diplaying properly because the destination location in the CopyTextureRegion function
wasn't aligned properly.

- Made progress on screen resize and the moving screen causing freeze bug. Fixed by moving render out of windows message loop
- Added gltf file loader. Currently only works with files that have vertex color defined per vertex.
    - Moved to DrawIndexedInstanced by defalut

TODO:
1. Add texture to model load.
2. Clean up model / model load code, move to own file?
3. Add default scaling, controls, lighting

NOTES:

Due to the combination of backside culling and DirectX + opengl z axis being swapped, at first, the models weren't being shown.
It was only after I had added code to the model load that flipped the z axis that the models began to show. Originally, the z axis
of the cube was flipped, thus after the combination of Z buffer depth culling(?), and backside culling, nothing ended up on the render target.

Goal: Build a Model Viewer app that can load the Sponza Scene, as well as others

Results:
- Load scene dynamicaly when user enters scene path
- Responsibly manage resources for each loaded scene
- ImGui for GUI
- Camera to move around scene. uses keyboard and mouse controls
- option to make fullscreen
