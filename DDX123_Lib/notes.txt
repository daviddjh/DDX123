Fixed the Critical Error c0000374. It was a buffer overrun in sprintf. Maybe I
should've used sprintf_s, maybe not.

Next Steps:

- Shader reflection would be sick
- Specify shader visibility for texture/buffer, default to visible to all.
- Fix the weird buffer bind thing where Resource_manager and slot can be 0, 
    Shader reflection?
- Once over all userland to find annoying / bad / ugly things.

Have texture loading and displaying. Also have an odd "Critical Error Detected"
when setting the pipeline state, but only sometimes. Watch out for backface culling 
using vertex winding order (?).

Shader reflection would be sick.

Working on constant buffers. Creation and descriptors.

Hello World!.. The triangle has arrived!
Just dealt with the most fustrating bug. Hard coded a single triangle to
test the framework, and, naturally, nothing showed. I tried to go as simple
as possible, even pulled out PIX to debug the issue. After toying with PIX,
and actually fixing a few things, still no triangle. PIX was showing the triangle
making it past the vertex shader, but the pixel shader still had no invocations.
Finally I peeked into the "Tools" tab within PIX to find that my only primative
was being culled for frontface/backface culling. Swapped some of the values around
in the triangle verticies and bam. Hello triangle!
